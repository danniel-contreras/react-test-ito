## About Vite

Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.It consists of two major parts:

-A dev server that provides [rich feature](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) enhancements over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), for example extremely fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

-A build command that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) section.
